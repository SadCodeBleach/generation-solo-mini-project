# Sadat-Awuma_Mini-Project

This project is based on creating a realistic small appliction that would be used by a coffee shop.

## Description

Furthermore, contained within the app there will be four seperate menus: Main Menu, Product Menu, Courier Menu, Orders Menu. Each menu excluding the main menu will have options to list, add, update and remove certain artefacts from the app (products, couiers, customer details.). Additionally all information has been uploaded and retained within a database.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Created on a Windows 10 system.
- You must create an .env with these specifics:

mysql_host=localhost
mysql_user=root
mysql_pass=password
mysql_db=mini_project

### Installing

* I will implement a sh.bash script that will set up the Docker container required to run the database.

### Executing program

* Path to navigate = 'sadat-awuma-mini-project\source\
* To execte = 'py app_v3.py'


## Help

* Issue in orders menu from line 207 regarding saving multiple products to an  order,  overwrites insteads of adds.
* Orders database table is not normalised for the sake of function simpicity.
